Hawaii Jitterbugs DJ Guidlines

Introduction
This document is intended to be a set of basic guidelines for those who are interested in developing their skills as a DJ for swing dancing in our local scene (Honolulu).  As such, it is limited in its scope.  It is not meant to be a strict set of rules, nor to stifle anyone’s individual approach to selecting and playing music.  It is our hope that these guidelines will help novices in their efforts to begin exploring swing music.

Working with a Sound System
-make sure the system works before you start your set
-mute the channel you’re plugging into before connecting to or disconnecting from it
-use channel volume (not master volume) 
-adjusting highs down can cut a lot of hiss/static
-adjusting mids higher can add more brightness/clarity
-lows are usually set between 11 o’clock and 1 o’clock
-if all the levels are adjusted in the same direction, reset the levels to baseline and use channel volume instead
-start with computer/input volume set to 50%
-input volume from user (computer/storage medium) affects the amount of information/data entering system, if too high then output will be clipped/missing sound
-do a sound check prior to an event, determine volume/dead spots/etc.

Dealing with audio feedback
-before your set starts, zero every channel except the one you’re using

Walking the floor
-check volume levels and sound quality from multiple points on the floor

Running the Dance

Watching/Reading the floor
-how many couples are dancing
-how do people react to your song selection
-who is or is not dancing (beginners, advanced dancers)
-what style are people dancing (lindy, balboa, charleston)
-what is the energy level of the room
-what is the mood of the room
-how can you affect the above conditions

Breaks between songs
-intentionally manage the gaps between songs

Breaks for announcements
-keep announcements brief and to the point
-refer people to facebook/website/other media for details

Birthday songs/Jams
-have 2 or 3 songs at a mid-range tempo set aside for jams
-combine birthday/out of towner jams, do only one jam per night

Line Dances
-keep a playlist of line dance songs, but only play them when that line dance is intended to result (playing a song associated with a line dance could inadvertently start one)
-Franky Manning Shim Sham (T’aint What You Do, Tuxedo Junction, Shim Sham Song)
-Dean Collins Shim Sham (Back Bay Shuffle)
-Tranky Doo (The Dipsy Doodle)

Mechanism for constructive criticism/guidance
-ask people for feedback

Requests
-accommodate requests as long as they adhere to the general music guidelines
-try not to disrupt the flow of your set list when adding in a request

Evaluation/improvement
-examine whether you accomplished your goals
-keep track of how the floor reacts to your song selections
